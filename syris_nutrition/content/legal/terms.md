# Terms of Service (syris-nutrition)

**Last updated:** 26 January 2026

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of **syris-nutrition** (the “App”). By creating an account, signing in, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.

## 1) Who we are

The App is operated by **Dominic Ody** under the **SYRIS** project (“we”, “us”).
Contact: **[domody11@gmail.com](mailto:domody11@gmail.com)**

## 2) Invite-only beta

The App is currently provided as an **invite-only beta**. We may change features, limits, or availability at any time, and may suspend or revoke access (for example, for misuse or operational reasons).

## 3) Eligibility

You must be at least **13 years old** to use the App.
If you are under the age of majority in your country, you confirm you have permission to use the App under applicable local laws.

## 4) The App is not medical advice

The App provides nutrition tracking and estimates for informational purposes only. It is **not medical advice** and not a medical device. If you have health concerns or a medical condition, consult a qualified professional.

Nutrition values may be inaccurate because they can be based on:

- barcode database entries (including third-party data),
- user-entered data,
- portion estimates,
- recipes and aggregation logic.

## 5) Accounts and sign-in links

- Accounts are email-based and use **magic link** sign-in.
- You are responsible for keeping access to your email account secure.
- Do not share your account credentials or sign-in links.

## 6) Your content

“User Content” includes foods, recipes, meals, goals, and other information you add to the App.

- **You own your User Content.**
- You grant us a limited, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, process, and display your User Content **only** to operate the App (syncing, calculating totals, showing your history, etc.).

## 7) OpenFoodFacts and third-party services

The App can look up product information via the **OpenFoodFacts** public API. When you scan a barcode or search foods, requests may be made from your device to OpenFoodFacts. See the Privacy Policy for details.

If you choose to submit a missing product to OpenFoodFacts, that submission is done under OpenFoodFacts’ terms and is outside our control.

## 8) Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- abuse, overload, scrape, or attempt to disrupt the App or related services;
- reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code (except where allowed by law);
- use the App for unlawful purposes;
- attempt unauthorized access to any accounts, data, or infrastructure.

## 9) Changes to the App, pricing, and terms

- The App is currently free for invitees.
- We may introduce paid plans in the future (e.g., for public access). If we do, we’ll provide notice in the App or via email before changes apply to you.
- We may update these Terms. Continued use after an update means you accept the updated Terms.

## 10) Suspension and termination

- You can stop using the App at any time and delete your account (see Privacy Policy).
- We may suspend or terminate access if we believe you violated these Terms or if necessary for security/operations.

## 11) Disclaimers

The App is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, error-free operation, or perfect accuracy.

## 12) Limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, profits, or business opportunities.

Nothing in these Terms limits liability where it cannot be excluded by law.

## 13) Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in **Scotland (UK)**, and disputes will be handled in the relevant courts unless mandatory consumer laws in your location require otherwise.
