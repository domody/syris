# Privacy Policy (syris-nutrition)

**Last updated:** 26 January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share personal data when you use **syris-nutrition** (the “App”).

## 1) Controller and contact

**Controller:** Dominic Ody (SYRIS project)
Contact: **[domody11@gmail.com](mailto:domody11@gmail.com)**

## 2) What we collect

Depending on how you use the App, we may collect:

### Account data

* Email address
* Account identifiers and authentication/session data (magic link sign-in)

### Nutrition and app content you enter

* Meals and meal items (food entries, portions)
* Custom foods you create
* Recipes you create
* Daily totals and targets
* If/when implemented: onboarding answers used to calculate goals (e.g., height, weight, age, activity level, goal type)

### Product lookup data (OpenFoodFacts)

* When you scan a barcode or search, your device may send queries to OpenFoodFacts. This can include the product code you searched and technical metadata like your IP address and user agent (handled by OpenFoodFacts and your device/network).

### Technical and security data

* Basic logs needed to operate and secure the service (e.g., timestamps, request metadata, and security events)

### Optional features (not currently enabled)

* Analytics / A/B testing (if added later)
* Profile pictures (if added later)
* Push notifications on mobile (if added later)

## 3) Special category (health-related) data

Dietary logs and body metrics (like weight/height) may be considered “data concerning health” under UK GDPR definitions.
If you choose to provide this information, we treat it as sensitive and apply additional protections.

## 4) Why we use your data (purposes)

We use data to:

* Provide core functionality (log meals, calculate totals, save recipes/custom foods, show history)
* Authenticate and keep accounts secure
* Maintain, debug, and improve the App
* Prevent abuse and protect the service

If we add optional features (analytics, A/B testing, profile photos, push notifications), we will use data for those purposes only as described at the time and update this policy.

## 5) Lawful bases (UK GDPR / GDPR)

We rely on:

* **Contract** (to provide the App features you request)
* **Legitimate interests** (to secure, maintain, and prevent abuse of the service)
* **Consent** (for optional features such as non-essential cookies/analytics, and future AI features)
* For health-related data: we rely on your **explicit consent** where required for special category data. (We recommend implementing an explicit checkbox during onboarding when you introduce body-metric goal calculation.)

## 6) Where data is stored and processed

* Primary hosting/storage is via **Supabase**, with the primary database in **Central EU (Frankfurt region)** (as configured).
* We may access the data from the UK/Gibraltar to operate and support the App.

If we add new processors (email delivery beyond Supabase, analytics, push notification providers, etc.), we will update this policy.

## 7) Who we share data with

We share data only with:

* **Service providers (“processors”)** needed to run the App (e.g., Supabase for hosting/auth/database).
* **OpenFoodFacts**: product lookups may be sent directly from your device to OpenFoodFacts when you scan/search.

We do **not** sell your personal data.

## 8) Admin access

At present, **only Dominic Ody** administers the App. Service providers (e.g., Supabase) may access data only as needed for providing their services (for example, infrastructure maintenance/support), under their terms.

## 9) Data retention

* Meal items, recipes, and custom foods are deleted when you delete them (hard delete in the app’s primary database).
* If you delete your account, we delete your data from the primary database.

**Backups:** We may retain encrypted backups for a limited period (we currently expect up to **30 days**) for recovery and security reasons. After that, backup copies expire/are overwritten.

## 10) Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights including:

* Access to your data
* Correction of inaccurate data
* Deletion of your data
* Data portability (export)

You can also withdraw consent for optional processing (where we rely on consent). GDPR transparency requirements include describing retention periods and rights.

**How to exercise rights:**

* Use in-app controls (export / delete account where available), or email **[domody11@gmail.com](mailto:domody11@gmail.com)**.

## 11) Complaints

If you’re in the UK, you can lodge a complaint with the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)**. (We’d appreciate the chance to help first via email.) 

## 12) Security

We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect your data, such as:

* HTTPS/TLS in transit
* Access controls for admin systems
* Database protections such as Supabase Row Level Security (where applicable)

No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

## 13) Children

The App is not intended for children under 13.

## 14) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy as the App evolves (e.g., when adding analytics, profile photos, push notifications, or AI features). We’ll update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice in the App.
