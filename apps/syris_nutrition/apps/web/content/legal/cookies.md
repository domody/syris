# Cookie Notice (Web)

**Last updated:** 26 January 2026

## 1) What we use today

Currently, the web app uses **strictly necessary** storage/cookies for:

* login sessions (Supabase auth),
* essential app operation.

We do **not** currently use advertising cookies.

## 2) If we add analytics or A/B testing

If we introduce non-essential cookies (e.g., analytics or A/B testing), we will ask for consent and provide an easy way to accept/reject/manage those cookies. Under UK guidance, non-essential cookies require valid consent and users must be able to disable them; “just continuing to use the site” isn’t enough.
