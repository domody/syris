# AI Features Addendum (SYRIS integration) — for later use

**Last updated:** 26 January 2026
**Status:** AI features currently disabled in syris-nutrition.

This addendum applies only if you enable and opt into SYRIS AI features inside the App.

## 1) What AI features do

If enabled, you may:

* describe a meal in text and receive an estimated nutrition breakdown, and/or
* submit a meal photo to receive an estimated nutrition breakdown.

These outputs are estimates and may be inaccurate.

## 2) What data is processed

If you use AI features, we process:

* your meal description text and/or meal photo,
* a system instruction asking SYRIS to estimate nutrition.

We aim not to include account identifiers in the AI request.

## 3) Where processing happens

Processing is performed on SYRIS infrastructure (currently a home server). If the App becomes public-scale, we may migrate processing to different infrastructure/providers, and we will update this addendum and the Privacy Policy.

## 4) Storage and retention

We do not intend to store meal descriptions/photos submitted for AI estimation beyond what’s required to produce a result, except where needed for security/abuse prevention or if you explicitly save an entry in your log.

## 5) No medical advice

AI features are informational only and not medical advice.

## 6) Consent and opt-out

AI features are **optional**. You can use the App without AI features.
You can withdraw consent by disabling AI features in settings.
