title: Repo Structure
description: The monorepo layout for core, apps, shared packages, and archive modules (with boundary rules).

**This repo is a monorepo on purpose: core stays stable, apps iterate fast, and shared packages form the only legal bridge.**

## Top-level layout

## Boundary rules

### Apps are sandboxed

Anything under `apps/*` is a standalone app and must **not** import from `core/*`.

Allowed:

* `apps/*` &gt; `packages/*`

Not allowed:

* `apps/*` &gt; `core/*`

This keeps core stable and prevents “UI app quietly depending on core internals.”

### Core owns integrations

Core integrations and tools live under `core/syris_core/src/syris_core/…` because:

* they deploy together
* they share secrets/scopes policy
* they participate in the same audit/trace runtime

## Where SYRIS v3 lives

All SYRIS runtime code belongs in:

* `core/syris_core/src/syris_core/`

Including:

* pipeline (normalize/route/execute)
* task engine
* scheduler/watchers/rules
* tool runtime + integrations registry
* observability (audit, projections, telemetry)
* API server and operator controls
* worker/sandbox manager

## Running locally (intent)

Core:

* `uv sync`
* `uv run syris` (control plane)
* `uv run syris-api` (API server)
* `uv run syris-worker` (workers/sandbox)

Apps:

* `bun dev` in each app (dashboard/docs/nutrition)

## Docs as a product

Docs are treated as an app because:

* they need navigation/search
* they should be easy to keep updated
* they become the “living memory” of the system

The docs app reads its content from local `content/docs/*` within the app, avoiding cross-boundary filesystem hacks.
