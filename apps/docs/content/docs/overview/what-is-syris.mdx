title: What is SYRIS?
description: SYRIS is a single-user, always-on personal operating system for automation, orchestration, and proactive assistance.

**SYRIS is not a chat bot. It is a personal operating system for automation and orchestration.**

Most “assistants” are optimized around messaging: you send text, it replies, maybe calls a tool.

SYRIS is different. It’s a **24/7 control plane** that continuously ingests stimuli from the world (messages, schedules, device events, rules, webhooks), turns them into normalized events, and safely executes actions through a capability- and policy-driven runtime.

SYRIS is built around this core shape:

- **Omnichannel in** &gt; normalized `MessageEvent`
- **Rules-first routing** &gt; deterministic fast paths when possible
- **Plan/Execute** &gt; immediate actions or resumable multi-step tasks
- **Tools + integrations** &gt; capability registry, scoped permissions, retry discipline
- **Audit + telemetry** &gt; everything queryable via API (dashboard-first), no log spelunking

## Goals

SYRIS is designed to be:

- **Always-on, restart-resilient:** resumes safely after crashes/restarts.
- **Operator-friendly:** you can always answer “what is it doing and why?”
- **Proactive:** timers, alarms, schedules, watchers, and rules can initiate actions.
- **Safe by default:** autonomy levels, confirmation gates, dry-run previews, least privilege.
- **Observable by design:** append-only audit events + queryable projections for a dashboard.

## What SYRIS does

SYRIS coordinates:

- **Home/IoT automation:** Home Assistant and device control, with anti-flap and quiet-hours policies.
- **Timers, alarms, and schedules:** first-class, persistent, visible, operator-controllable.
- **Rules engine:** IFTTT-style rules that trigger workflows via events (auditable and debounced).
- **Task orchestration:** multi-step workflows with checkpoints, retries, pause/resume, cancellation.
- **Integrations + tools:** adapters that conform to strict interfaces and declare capabilities/scopes.
- **System awareness:** a queryable system state surface (tasks, queues, schedules, health, autonomy).
- **Long-running work:** optional sandbox workers for heavy jobs (gated; not default).
- **Future vision stream:** pluggable visual event sources (treated like any other inbound adapter).

## What SYRIS is not (non-goals for now)

- Multi-user / multi-tenant.
- A “perfect chat memory” social conversation agent.
- Full duplex low-latency voice DSP (we process transcripts and events).
- A distributed microservice platform (start modular monolith; design seams).
- A dashboard UI product (we design the API surfaces and state model).

## The design philosophy

SYRIS optimizes for:

- **Correctness > cleverness**
- **Traceability > throughput**
- **Deterministic fast paths > LLM everywhere**
- **Modular monolith > microservices**
- **Idempotency by default > best-effort retries**
- **APIs for everything > “check logs”**

## A simple mental model

Think of SYRIS as a loop:

1. Something happens &gt; event ingested
2. Event normalized &gt; `MessageEvent`
3. Router decides:
   - **Fast lane:** execute immediately (bounded latency)
   - **Work lane:** create/resume a Task (checkpointed)
   - **Gated:** request approval (risk/autonomy policy)
4. Tools execute with idempotency + retries
5. Everything emits audit events + telemetry
6. Dashboard queries state and controls the system safely
