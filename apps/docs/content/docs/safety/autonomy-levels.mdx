title: Autonomy Levels
description: How SYRIS decides what it can do automatically vs what requires confirmation, based on risk and policy.
---

**Autonomy exists so SYRIS can be useful without being dangerous.**

Autonomy is always interpreted together with **risk level** and **tool scopes**. The same action may be allowed or gated depending on the autonomy level and policy.

## Autonomy levels (A0–A4)

| Level | Name | Default behavior | Effectful actions |
|------:|------|------------------|------------------|
| A0 | Suggest-only | Drafts, previews, explanations | Never executes effectful actions |
| A1 | Confirm required | Can prepare actions + ask to confirm | Executes only after explicit approval for anything effectful |
| A2 | Scoped autonomy | Automates low-risk actions | Low-risk auto; medium/high requires approval |
| A3 | High autonomy | Operates broadly within granted scopes | Most actions auto; high/critical gated |
| A4 | Full autonomy | Dangerous; usually disabled | Nearly all actions auto; still respects hard safety constraints |

## Risk levels (guidance)

| Risk | Examples | Typical gate |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Low | Read-only queries, status checks, local notes | Usually allowed in A2+ |
| Medium | Controlling a single device, sending to private channel, creating calendar event | Often requires approval in A1/A2 |
| High | Deleting data, controlling many devices, sending broadly, quiet-hours notifications | Approval required |
| Critical | Purchases, public posting, irreversible actions, wide “blast radius” | Strong gate + explicit operator flow |

## Confirmation gates

A gate is a persisted `Approval` request that includes:
- why it’s gated (risk/autonomy/policy)
- the exact payload to execute (no “surprises”)
- how to approve/deny (dashboard or explicit reply)
- expiry window

Approvals are **audited** and **trace-linked** to the originating event/task.

## Dry-run previews

For risky tools, SYRIS should generate a preview:
- message render preview
- device state diffs (before &gt; after)
- patch previews for code changes
- “what will happen” summary

Execution must re-use the same idempotency key as the preview.

## Fast lane vs work lane (and gating heavy work)

- **Fast lane** is default for simple commands (e.g., “turn off lights”).
- **Work lane** is reserved for multi-step tasks.
- **Sandbox work** is reserved for heavy jobs and should be gated:
  - explicit `/sandbox` intent
  - or explicit operator confirmation when SYRIS wants to escalate

## Hard safety constraints (always enforced)

Regardless of autonomy level:
- least privilege scopes are enforced
- secrets are never exposed
- redaction is applied to audit payloads
- anti-spam / anti-flap policies remain active
